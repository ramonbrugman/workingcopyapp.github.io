        <p><a href="/">Working Copy</a> is a full featured Git client for iOS. Git is a powerful version-control system and can take some time to master.
            The same is true for Working Copy, and even though you will not need to work with the command-line, some understanding of Git is needed.
            If you are not confident with Git's core concepts you should read the first few chapters of <a target="reference" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> by Scott Chacon or the
            excellent <a target="reference" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">tutorials</a>
            Atlassian has made available.</p>

        <h3 id="cloning-repos">1.1 Cloning repositories</h3>
        <div class="left">
         <img class="animated" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/clone-77.jpg" alt="Video showing cloning on phone: User presses + in the upper right corner and picks clone. Picks protocol, types username, hostname and path on the Other tab. Picks repository from list on GitHub tab. Presses Clone to start transfer. When cloning completes the repository contents are shown."
           srcset="img/clone-77.jpg 200w, img/clone-77-400.jpg 400w, img/clone-77-645.jpg 645w"/>
        </div>
        <p>The first step is to get hold of a local copy of the Git repositories you want to access.
            Duplicating a repository from a remote server is
            known as cloning, and you do this by pressing + on the list of repositories.</p>
        <p>You provide a URL pointing to a repository on the Git remote you wish to clone from.
            Working Copy can transfer data from the remote using http, https or ssh protocols. However, you should be careful
            using http transfer since data will be sent without encryption, which means your login credentials and your source
            code can be intercepted. If you are not on a trusted network you should avoid using http transfer.</p>
        <p id="hosting-services">Conveniently for BitBucket and GitHub users, you can enter your credentials and get a
            <a href="#clone-catalog">list of repositories</a>.
            Cloning then amounts to picking the repository and tapping clone. You are not restricted to these Git services.
            If you are using some other Git hosting service or a private server to host your repositories, copy-paste your
            URL into the top field and Working Copy will clone just as well.</p>
        <p id="itunes-import">You can also import repositories from a Mac or PC by dragging directories into iTunes Document lists.
            If the directory does not contain a .git subdirectory at top-level, Working Copy assumes you want a new repository with
            all these files added. Zip-files can also be dragged into iTunes.</p>

    </div><div class="inner">

    <div class="right"><img src="img/css-content-45.png" onload="imgLoaded(this)"
     srcset="img/css-content-45.png 200w, img/css-content-45-400.png 400w, img/css-content-45-645.png 645w"/></div>
    <h3 id="accessing-files">1.2 Accessing files</h3>
    <p>Data in Working Copy is organized as repositories, containing directories, which themselves contain
        either sub-directories or files.
        Tapping a file shows the file content, the changes to the file and the status of the file.</p>

    <p>File content is shown with syntax highlighting for sourcecode and a preview of html and document files.
        Tap the action-button in the upper-right corner to Edit the file or to send the file to other applications such as Mail.</p>

    <p>The editing inside Working Copy is bare-bones and neutral in that
        neither programming languages, markdown nor regular text
        files get special treatment. If you are performing heavy editing consider using a
        specialized text-editor app for programming, markdown or other purposes.
        You can read <a href="#extending-ios">more</a> about using Working Copy in combination
        with other applications.</p>

</div><div class="inner">

    <h3 id="committing-changes">1.3 Committing changes</h3>
    <div class="left"><img src="img/commit-sheet-32.png" onload="imgLoaded(this)"
     srcset="img/commit-sheet-32.png 200w, img/commit-sheet-32-400.png 400w, img/commit-sheet-32-645.png 645w" /></div>
    <p>When you have file modifications the Changes tab lights up. You can see what has been added in green and what has
        been deleted in red. If you are satisfied with the changes you can commit
        them to the repository with a button on the Status tab.
        A faster way, however, is to swipe left on the file in the directory listing.
        Swiping left can generally be performed on lists of files,
        directories and repositories allowing convenient access to frequent actions.</p>

    <p>You can commit a single file, multiple files or the entire repository at once, and it is considered good practice to make a
        commit represent one conceptual change to your repository. Following this practice also makes it easier to come up with concise
        yet descriptive commit descriptions.
    </p>

    <p>When you have made one or more commits your on-device repository is seen as being ahead of the remote repository
        and you <em>push</em> these commits to the remote. Because <em>Commit</em> and <em>Push</em> are distinct
        actions you can <em>Commit</em> while offline and <em>Push</em> once you get back online.</p>

</div>
    <div class="inner">

        <h3 id="up-to-date">1.4 Staying up-to-date</h3>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/status-79.jpg" onload="imgLoaded(this)"
          srcset="img/status-79.jpg 200w, img/status-79-400.jpg 400w, img/status-79-645.jpg 645w"/></div>

        <p>Commits can be pushed to the remote from many sources.
            Other people contribute their work, or you could be doing something
            on a regular computer or another iOS device which results in commits that end up on the remote. You need to
            <a href="#purchase">unlock</a> the ability to <em>Push</em> with an in-app purchase.</p>

        <p>You get commits back into Working Copy through a two-step process where you <em>Fetch</em> and <em>Merge</em>.
            <em>Fetch</em> reads commits from the
            server and requires a network connection. The commits will not be integrated with the local data on your device until
            you <em>Merge</em>, which will combine the new commits from the server with your local data.</p>

        <p>Sometimes data cannot be automatically combined because your local changes conflict with the changes from the commits fetched.
            These conflicts need to be resolved by hand-picking the correct content of the conflicted files and choosing
            <em>Resolve</em> from the action button.</p>

        <p>As a short-hand you can <em>Fetch</em>, <em>Merge</em> and <em>Push</em> a repository with the <em>Sync</em> button
            on the detail screen of your remote.</p>
        <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    </div>
    <h2 id="remotes">2. Remotes</h2>

    <div class="inner">
        <div class="left"><img class="left" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/remote-details-81.jpg"
        srcset="img/remote-details-81.jpg 200w, img/remote-details-81-400.jpg 400w, img/remote-details-81-645.jpg 645w"/></div>
        <p>Git remotes are server-side duplicates of your repositories with full history.
            These can be services such as GitHub, BitBucket etc. or they can be be privately hosted servers.</p>

        <p>When you clone a repository, the URL of the remote repository is your starting point. Working Copy supports ssh, https and
            http remotes and the URL consists of protocol scheme, the hostname, username and the path to the repository on the host.
            The following are typical examples of remote URLs:</p>

<pre>https://user@git.company.se/home/user/site.git
ssh://andrew@company.se/home/andrew/git/site.git/
andrew@company.se/home/andrew/git/site.git/
</pre>
        <p>The last two URLs are equivalent since ssh is the default protocol.</p>
        <p>If you enter the Repository page you can add or delete remotes. After cloning there is only a single “origin”
            remote and, in many scenarios, there is no need for additional remotes.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="clone-catalog">2.1 Clone catalog</h3>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/clone-catalog.png" /></div>

        <p>When cloning repositories from BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab you can enter your credentials to get a list of repositories to clone.
            Working Copy tries to show the most relevant repositories at the top, these being the ones where you have administrative
            or write privileges. Your GitHub Gists and BitBucket Snippets are also available from this list.
        </p>
        <p>If the list is long, enter keywords in the search field in order to only see repositories containing these.
            If you do not see the repository you wish to clone, you can still copy-paste the clone URL into the top-field manually.</p>

        <p>Working Copy lets you configure private instances of
            BitBucket <a target="hosting" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server">Server</a> (previously known as Stash),
            GitHub <a target="hosting" href="https://enterprise.github.com/">Enterprise</a> and
            <a target="hosting" href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/">GitLab</a> from Working Copy settings.
            You enter the hostname of your server and the URL scheme and kind of service is identified automatically.
           </p>
        <div class="left" style="margin-top: 1em"><img class="left" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/hosting-provider.png" /></div>
        <p>In addition to listing repositories, this integration lets you create new repositories from within the
            remote detail screen of Working Copy. </p>
        <p>When you add hosting providers it is often a good idea to disable the built-in provides you are
         not using to avoid clutter in other parts of Working Copy. </p>

        <p>Working Copy will not store your BitBucket or GitHub password used to populate the list of remotes,
            but rather an authentication
            token that you can revoke from the BitBucket or GitHub settings. This is why you are required to login through Safari
            rather than inside Working Copy.</p>

        <p>When actually cloning the repository you cannot use the authentication token for the transfer and will either need to
            configure a SSH authentication key or enter your password inside Working Copy. This password is stored in an encrypted
            keychain maintained by iOS that is only accessible when your phone is unlocked.
            If you are using the two-factor authentication, the password authentication will not work and you are required to use
            SSH key authentication for transfer.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="ssh-keys">2.2 SSH keys</h3>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/ssh-config-30.png"
                                srcset="img/ssh-config-30.png 200w, img/ssh-config-30-400.png 400w, img/ssh-config-30-645.png 645w"/></div>

        <p>SSH transfers support password authentication but also public/private key authentication for improved security.
            The public part of SSH key corresponds to a padlock that you use to lock-down resources. The private part of the SSH
            key corresponds to the physical key that opens the padlock. Your private key must be kept secret and the public key can be
            distributed to servers where you want to store remote repositories.</p>

        <p>If you tap “Connect with BitBucket” or “Connect with GitHub” your public key will automatically be registered with
            BitBucket or GitHub. For other Git hosting providers such as OpenShift or GitLab you need to enter your public key in
            the settings page for that service. The details will depend upon the service in question, but your first step is to Export the public key.
            When using a Linux server, you need to append the public key to
            $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file.</p>
        <p>Working Copy can import private keys in either OpenSSH or Putty format. This choice is available when
        looking at new SSH Keys that have not yet been generated.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="ssh-troubleshooting">2.3 SSH Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>If you are having problems authenticating with an SSH server you should make sure the public key installed on the server
            matches the private key in Working Copy. If you have some other SSH client on your device or computer, you should make sure
            you can connect from these without problems. If this works, you must also make sure you use the same SSH key in Working Copy,
            possibly importing the private key from the other application.</p>
        <p>When exporting the public key you end up with something on the form:</p>
        <pre>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1…g+y4Pfz9 Working Copy - device - 2015-24-12 08:10:00</pre>
        <p>Everything after the second space is just a comment, that makes it easier to
            determine where and how the key was created. It can sometimes help to remove this comment,
            before registering the key with your Git server.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="heruko-remotes">2.4 Heroku Remotes</h3>
        <p>It is possible to deploy to
            <a href="http://heroku.com/" target="heroku">Heroku</a> using Git.
            You need to setup a second remote for your repository that points
            to your Heroku application. Since the
            <a target="heroku" href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/">Heroku Toolbelt</a>
            is not available on iOS, you need to manually configure the remote. </p>
            <p>The easiest way to do this is to
                <a target="heroku" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote">setup your remote</a>
                on a regular computer and determine the remote
            details on the command line by entering:</p>
            <pre>git remote -v</pre>
            <p>You then create a new remote from this URL in Working Copy. Note that username and password
                for remote is not your Heroku account credentials. You will find this information
                in your home directory in the hidden file:</p>

    <p>Image changes can be viewed in a split-mode where zooming one image will make the other one follow -
        making it easy to focus on the details.
        If you are unsure as to where the changes are in an image, use the Color mode that
        highlights changed areas in green where identical areas are without color. Cut mode is useful for images with
        global changes and allows you to drag and rotate a partitioning line in such a way that everything on one side is the old image.
        The previous image will have a red border, and the new one a green border.</p>

    <p>Files can sometimes be conflicted because there have been changes
        made to the file that could not be automatically merged.
        This will occur when two people work on the same part of a file at once and
        they commit changes without knowing about the other changes made.
        In such cases, you will then need to pick one or the other, or a combined version of the file.
        When you edit the file there are conflict
        markers showing how the two different versions of the file disagree on content.
        You need to sort this out and mark the file as Resolved,
        which can be done with the action button.</p>

    <p>The Status tab says whether the file is modified and allows you to commit or revert changes.

        <p>You can commit changes to your files for the entire repository, for all files in a sub-directory or for a specific file.
            If you do not wish to commit some of your files you can Revert to how they where at the last commit.
            The files taken into account are determined by where in the directory structure you initiate the commit.
            As a short-hand you can swipe left on a repository, directory or file to commit.</p>
        <div class="left"><img class="left" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/status-modified-19.png"

        <p>During commit you are shown a list of changed files and can view differences for individual files by pressing the button
            that shows the number of lines added or deleted. Files with a checkmark will be included in the commit and you toggle the
            checkmark by tapping the file.
            Working Copy will push the commit to the remote right away if you enable the <em>+Push</em> button.</p>

        <p>As a general rule you should make commits with a single purpose and only include the changed files that helped achieve this purpose.
            You should write a message in the top line describing this purpose;
            if it is hard to write something short but concrete you might
            need to break your commit into smaller parts.</p>

        <h3 id="commit-history">4.1 Commit history</h3>
        <p>The value of well-drafted commit messages becomes apparent when looking at a log of previous commits.
            You may do this for either the entire repository, a directory with all its files or for single files.
            If your commit messages are meaningful, even if you return to a project after months or years you have a much
            better chance of making sense of the source-code.
            Tap a commit to see specific changes this commit made to the files in question.</p>

        <p>The images shown in commit-logs are determined from the email-address of the person making the commit with the
            help of <a target="gravatar" href="http://gravatar.com/">gravatar.com</a>.
            At the commit-list for the entire repository you can Checkout old versions of your
            files by swiping left on a commit. Your repository will be in a “detached head” state where you cannot commit any changes,
            but if you make modifications and wish to keep these, you should create a new branch.
        </p>
        <p>Checking out the topmost commit will reattach the head in such a way that your repository is back to normal.</p>

        <p>A great advantage of Git compared to other version-control software is the ease at which you can branch your
            repository to work independently on different things.
            Once you are confident with the work undertaken in a branch you can merge
            it back to one of your main branches.</p>

        <p>In Working Copy you can do this from the Repository screen by tapping the current
            branch name to access a list of branches. Switching to another branch is done by tapping the list.</p>

        <p> You create new branches from the current one with the right-most button in the upper-right corner and you merge back
            another branch into your current branch with the other button in the upper-right.
            Swipe left to rename or delete branches.</p>

        <div style="clear: left"></div>
        <h3 id="commit-graph">4.3 Commit Graph</h3>

        <p>To explore repository changes across branches use the Commit Graph available from the Repository screen.</p>
        <p>Commits are presented in chronological order with lines showing which commits are based on each other,
            with tags and branch heads displayed as well as the commit message summary, date and information about the author of the commit.
        </p>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/commit-graph.png"
          srcset="img/commit-graph.png 200w, img/commit-graph-400.png 400w, img/commit-graph-645.png 645w" /></div>
        <p>Pinch to zoom will let you explore additional details, such as the full commit message, the full name of the author
            rather than initials, a commit identifier and the files modified by this commit. If you connect an external
        screen or projector to your device, you will get a full-screen Commit Graph without any interface elements
        obscuring the view. This makes for a convenient tool when your team needs to discuss the project.</p>
        <p>You can tap and hold or double-tap the elements of a commit for additional actions, where
            the commit message itself takes you to a detail view.</p>
        <p>You can copy the author email to the clipboard or start composing a email to the author.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to view the commit date in your calendar to see what else happened around this time and
            when <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone" target="fantastical">Fantastical</a> is installed,
            it will be used instead of the built-in Calendar app.</p>

    <h2 id="extending-ios">5. Extending iOS</h2>
    <div class="inner">
        <div class="left"><img class="left" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/textastic-87.png"
                               srcset="img/textastic-87.png 200w, img/textastic-87-400.png 400w, img/textastic-87-645.png 645w"/></div>

        <p>Working Copy takes advantage of recent improvements to iOS allowing richer cooperation between applications.
            All repositories in Working Copy can be accessed by other applications using the iCloud document picker.
            Once a file inside Working Copy is picked, the other application is allowed to read and make changes to this file
            and these changes stay inside Working Copy. You can perform editing in this application and switch to
            Working Copy to review and commit changes. On the iPad you can use
            <a target="iPad-guide" href="https://help.apple.com/ipad/9/#/iPad5afb8ee4">Slide Over</a> or
            <a target="iPad-guide" href="https://help.apple.com/ipad/9/#/iPad63ea0cbb">Split View</a>
            to avoid switching between Working Copy and the editing application.</p>

        <p><a target="app" href="http://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic</a> is a very good general purpose/programmers editor
            that works well with Working Copy and you use Open…
            to open the document picker. Alexander Blach the developer of Textastic has made a
            <a target="video" href="https://www.google.dk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC0QtwIwAmoVChMI2oe0yO72xwIVB-saCh2t3wTr&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRB1Blvi7K9I&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDRGhgjmYSFcNnYSIMSM3SaZn3wg&amp;sig2=vWrSbTLsWgOTE6oklVX_FQ">video</a>
            showing how. Initially you need to enable Working Copy as a Location choice by
            picking <em>More</em>. </p>
        <p><a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Byword</a> is a special purpose Markdown
            editor that can also use the iCloud document picker to edit inside Working Copy
            by choosing Open Other… and many users also like
            <a target="app" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/koder/id439271237?mt=8&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1000lHq">Koder</a>.
            If you need to work with images

            is the best choice.</p>

        <div style="clear: left"></div>

        <h3 id="saving">5.1 Saving to Working Copy</h3>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/edit-in-app.png"
         srcset="img/edit-in-app.png 200w, img/edit-in-app-400.png 400w, img/edit-in-app-645.png 645w" /></div>
        <p>Saving files into Working Copy can be accomplished by way of a Share sheet, the mechanism also used to share files
            with Mail or Messages.
            Picking Working Copy on a Share sheet will present a list of repositories, where you drill down to the
            directory where the file should be saved.
            To overwrite existing files you tap a file before confirming. Otherwise you will be prompted to
            enter a new file name.</p>

        <p>After saving a file you can optionally <em>Commit</em> this change immediately and <em>Push</em> to
            the remote right away.</p>

        <h3 style="padding-top: 15px" id="edit-in-app">5.2 Edit in App</h3>

        <p>In some situations you browse files in Working Copy and need to pick out a file you want to edit in
        another application. The action-button in the upper-right corner used to present a share-sheet also
        lets you send files to other applications.</p>

        <p><em>Open In…</em> is the most basic choice and lets you pick any app supporting that type of file.
         Editing will be on a copy of the file and it must be transferred back to Working Copy
            with "Save in Working Copy".
        </p>
        <p>If <a target="app" href="http://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic</a> is installed you can
        use the <em>Edit in Textastic</em> action. A copy of the file is transferred to
        Textastic with a filename such that Working Copy can recognise the file later on,
            saving you the trouble of picking the destination file. </p>
        <p id="edit-in-editorial">
            <em>Edit in Editorial</em>
            works similarly, but requires a workflow inside
            <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Editorial</a>
            to facilitate file transfer. It
            is installed the first time you use <em>Edit in Editorial</em> or if you delete
            or rename the workflow. This workflow serves a dual purpose in that it receives files
            when activated from Working Copy, and returns files to Working Copy when activated from Editorial. </p>
    <p>The <em>Edit in <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Byword</a></em>
        action has one extra step, where you need to use the share sheet to save back to Working Copy.
    </p><p>
        You will only see actions for apps you have already installed and you can change the order
        by picking More to the far right.
    </p>
    </div>

        <h3 id="webdav-server">5.3 WebDAV access</h3>
        <div class="left"><img class="left" onload="imgLoaded(this)" src="img/webdav-settings.png"

        <p>In situations where you need to transfer entire directory hierarchies,
            a good way to get files into and out of Working Copy is the built-in
            <a target="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> server. It is also
            the best way to let
            <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda-for-ios/id500906297?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Coda</a>
            edit the files in your Git repositories.
        </p>
        <p>As a security precaution you need to start the server before each use and it automatically shuts down
            after five minutes of inactivity. You should be cautious of using the WebDAV server on untrusted
            networks as the transfers are unencrypted. In these cases you should restrict yourself
            to connections from applications on the same device, as the traffic cannot be intercepted when
            it never leaves your device. Local connections are also possible in situations without an Internet
            connection. You need to specify <em>localhost</em> as the hostname in these situations.</p>
        <p>Applications on iOS are restricted as to how long they are allowed to run in the background. If you start
           the WebDAV server and switch to some other application, you will be given a grace period before
            Working Copy and its WebDAV server is terminated and a notification will inform you of this.
        </p>
       <p>On newer iPads running iOS 9, you can use
           <a target="iPad-guide" href="https://help.apple.com/ipad/9/#/iPad63ea0cbb">Split View</a>
           multitasking to keep two applications in the foreground.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using applications such as <a target="app" href="http://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic</a> and
            <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-ios/id917432930?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Transmit</a>
            that can work with both WebDAV and SSH
            servers, you can deploy from a Git repository to a standard Linux server by transferring
            the directory hierarchy from Working Copy into the other application and then from the other
            application onto the server.
            Here you can watch a short <a target="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EF6TbOEz0">video</a>
            illustrating this.

        <p>Working Copy supports the <a href="/url-schemes.html">x-callback-url</a> mechanism for inter-app coorporation.
            This allows reading and writing files from repositories as
            well as committing changes and pushing commits to your remotes. As a security measure this mechanism needs
            to be enabled from the settings
            page and is protected by a random key.</p>

        <p>By using applications such as
            <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Workflow</a>

        <h3 style="padding-top: 15px" id="purchase">6.1 How to purchase</h3>
        <p>Working Copy is a free download but you need to pay to unlock the ability to push commits back
            to remote servers. You can do this for 3 weeks or permanently where the permanent unlock
            is remembered by Apple such that you can restore this purchase on other devices using
            the same Apple ID.

        </p>
        <p> Alternatively you can use
            <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-enterprise/id965019520?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Working Copy Enterprise</a>
            that has the same features and includes the in-app purchase.
            Avoiding in-app purchases makes it easier for IT departments to deploy
            the application to employee devices. </p>
            <p>
            If you are purchasing Working Copy for yourself,
            there is no advantage or disadvantage in picking the Enterprise version.
            Note that repositories in one app will not show up in the other.</p>
